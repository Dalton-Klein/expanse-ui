# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a React TypeScript application built with Create React App that appears to be a web-based game or interactive application called "Expanse UI". The project uses Three.js for 3D graphics, Redux for state management, and Socket.io for real-time communication.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server (runs on http://localhost:3000)
npm start

# Run tests in interactive watch mode
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run a single test file
npm test -- path/to/test.file
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Technologies
- **React 18** with TypeScript for the UI framework

- **React Three Fiber** (Three.js) for 3D graphics and experiences
- **Socket.io Client** for WebSocket connections
- **React Router** for client-side routing (using HashRouter)
- **SCSS** for styling

### Project Structure
- `/src/App.tsx` - Main application component that sets up routing, Redux provider, and socket connections
- `/src/index.tsx` - Entry point that renders the app with HashRouter
- `/src/store/` - Redux store configuration with persistence
  - `store.ts` - Store configuration with Redux Toolkit, Redux Observable, and Redux Persist
  - `userSlice.ts` - User state management
  - `interfaces.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for store

## Binary Greedy Meshing Implementation

This project implements a highly optimized binary greedy meshing algorithm based on TanTanDev's approach for voxel terrain rendering. The implementation is located in `/src/components/voxel2/engine/greedy-meshing/GreedyMesher.ts`.

### Algorithm Overview

The binary greedy meshing algorithm works in 4 main steps:

1. **Binary Encoding**: Convert 3D voxel data into binary columns separated by block type
2. **Face Culling**: Use bitwise operations to find face transitions (solid-to-air boundaries)
3. **Greedy Meshing**: Apply 2D greedy algorithm to merge adjacent faces into larger quads
4. **Geometry Generation**: Convert optimized quads to Three.js buffer geometry

### Key Technical Details

- **Chunk Size**: 30x30x30 voxels with 2-block padding for neighbor data (32x32x32 total)
- **Binary Representation**: Each axis column uses 32-bit integers for efficient bit operations
- **Face Directions**: 6 directions (±X, ±Y, ±Z) processed separately
- **Block Type Separation**: Different voxel types are processed independently for correct face culling

### Major Challenge: Non-Contiguous Face Patterns

During development, we encountered a critical issue with the greedy meshing algorithm when processing non-contiguous face patterns (e.g., two separated cubes).

#### The Problem
When processing faces at position [0,0] with bits at positions 2 and 6 (representing faces from two separate cubes):
- The algorithm would process bit 2 first, create a quad, and immediately clear bits 2-3
- This left bit 6 isolated in some positions, causing it to be split into multiple smaller quads
- Result: 14 quads instead of the optimal 12 quads for two cubes

#### Root Cause Analysis
The issue was **premature bit clearing** in the sequential processing approach:

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC APPROACH:
for each position {
  find first set bit
  expand quad
  clear bits immediately  // ← This caused fragmentation
}
```

#### Our Solution: Batch Processing
We implemented a batch processing approach that handles all contiguous bit groups at each position before clearing any bits:

```typescript
// IMPROVED APPROACH:
for each position {
  identify all contiguous bit groups
  for each group {
    expand quad optimally
    store quad info
  }
  clear all processed bits together  // ← Prevents fragmentation
}
```

### Implementation Details

#### Key Functions Added:
- `findContiguousBitGroups()`: Identifies all contiguous bit sequences in a column
- Modified `greedyMesh2D()`: Processes multiple groups per position before clearing bits

#### Algorithm Flow:
1. **Group Identification**: At each position, find all contiguous bit groups
2. **Independent Processing**: Each group is expanded optimally without interference
3. **Batch Clearing**: All processed bits are cleared together after quad creation

### Performance Impact

The solution provides:
- **Optimal Quad Count**: Each face region gets the largest possible quad representation
- **Correct Face Coverage**: No gaps or overlaps in the final mesh
- **Maintained Efficiency**: Preserves the binary algorithm's performance benefits
- **Pattern Agnostic**: Works correctly for any terrain configuration

### Test Patterns Used
During development, we used several test patterns to verify correctness:
- **Tiny Pattern**: 2x2x2 cube for basic functionality
- **Flat Pattern**: Large flat surface for greedy merging verification
- **Two Cubes Pattern**: Non-contiguous cubes that exposed the fragmentation issue
- **Stepped Pattern**: Variable height terrain for complex face scenarios

### Debug Process
The debugging process involved:
1. **Binary Pattern Analysis**: Examining bit patterns in face masks
2. **Quad Generation Logging**: Tracking how quads were created and bits cleared
3. **Step-by-step Debugging**: Following the algorithm through each processing step
4. **Root Cause Identification**: Discovering the premature bit clearing issue
5. **Solution Development**: Implementing the batch processing approach

### Current Status
✅ **SOLVED**: The binary greedy meshing algorithm now correctly handles all test patterns and produces optimal mesh quality with proper face merging.

The implementation successfully combines the efficiency of TanTanDev's binary approach with robust handling of edge cases, resulting in a production-ready voxel meshing solution.

## Critical Bug Fix: Phantom Face Generation at Chunk Boundaries

### The Problem

A critical bug was discovered where phantom faces were being rendered outside chunk boundaries when solid neighboring data was present in the padding. Specifically:

- **Symptom**: A 30x30 face would appear 1 voxel below the chunk boundary, facing downward
- **Visibility**: The phantom face could be seen when the camera was positioned below the chunk
- **Condition**: Only occurred when there was solid neighboring data in the padding layer

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the binary greedy meshing face culling logic. Here's what was happening:

1. **Binary Encoding**: Chunks are encoded as 32x32x32 with padding (positions 0-31)
   - Bit 0: Padding below chunk
   - Bits 1-30: Actual chunk data  
   - Bit 31: Padding above chunk

2. **Face Culling**: The algorithm correctly used padding data for neighbor-aware face culling
   - `thisTypeCol & ~(allSolidCol << 1)` for -Y faces
   - This correctly prevented faces when solid neighbors existed

3. **The Bug**: Face culling results included ALL 32 bits, including padding positions
   - Face masks were stored as 30x30x30 but each integer contained 32 bits
   - Bit 0 (padding position) could be set in face masks
   - Greedy meshing would find bit 0 and create a quad at y=0
   - Vertex generation used `y-1`, placing the face at y=-1 (outside chunk bounds)

### The Solution

Applied a bit mask `0x7FFFFFFE` to exclude padding bits (0 and 31) from face mask results:

```typescript
// CRITICAL: Mask to only include chunk positions (bits 1-30)
// Excludes padding positions (bits 0 and 31) to prevent phantom faces
const chunkMask = 0x7FFFFFFE; // 01111111111111111111111111111110
faceMasks[1][0][z - 1][x - 1] = (thisTypeCol & ~(allSolidCol << 1)) & chunkMask;
```

This ensures:
- ✅ Padding data is still used for correct neighbor-aware face culling
- ✅ Only chunk interior positions (1-30) can generate faces
- ✅ No phantom faces outside chunk boundaries
- ✅ Maintains rendering efficiency and correctness

### Key Insights

1. **Subtle 32→30 Transition**: The transition from 32-bit padded data to 30-bit chunk data was incomplete
2. **Bit Operations Complexity**: The face culling logic was correct, but the result storage included unwanted bits
3. **Debug Strategy**: Binary logging was essential to understand the bit-level operations
4. **Neighbor Data Necessity**: Padding data is crucial for efficient face culling - removing it would force rendering unnecessary faces at chunk boundaries

### Debugging Process

The bug was identified through:
1. Visual observation of phantom faces below chunk boundaries
2. Debug logging showing all -Y faces had bit 0 set (`00000001`)
3. Detailed bit operation logging revealing padding bits in face mask results
4. Understanding that face generation should only occur for chunk interior positions

This was an extremely subtle bug that required deep understanding of the binary encoding, face culling operations, and the relationship between padding data and face generation.
