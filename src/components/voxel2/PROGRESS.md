# Voxel2 System Implementation Progress

## Overview
This is a clean reimplementation of the voxel system with a debug-first, incremental approach.

## Architecture Philosophy
- **Debug-first**: Build comprehensive debugging tools before implementing features
- **Incremental development**: Each phase builds on rock-solid previous phase
- **Clean separation**: Rendering, terrain, optimization as separate concerns
- **A/B testable**: Always compare new features against known-good baseline

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Debug Infrastructure ⏳
- [ ] Basic type definitions (types.ts)
- [ ] Debug system with pattern generators
- [ ] Performance monitoring tools
- [ ] Test pattern infrastructure
- [ ] Material system

### Phase 2: Basic Rendering 🔄
- [ ] Simple chunk data structure
- [ ] Naive cube-per-voxel renderer
- [ ] Single chunk rendering
- [ ] Basic terrain generation (flat patterns)
- [ ] Visual validation

### Phase 3: Multi-Chunk System 📋
- [ ] Chunk loading/unloading
- [ ] Cross-chunk face culling
- [ ] Chunk management
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Advanced Features 📋
- [ ] Greedy meshing optimization
- [ ] A/B testing vs naive renderer
- [ ] LOD system
- [ ] Complex terrain generation

## Current Status: 🚀 Starting Phase 1

## Lessons Learned from Voxel1
1. **Start simple**: No LOD until basic system works perfectly
2. **Debug infrastructure first**: Pattern generators and comparison tools from day 1
3. **Clean interfaces**: Avoid mixing terrain generation with rendering concerns
4. **Systematic validation**: Test each feature in isolation before combining
5. **Coordinate system clarity**: Be very explicit about world vs local vs scaled coordinates

## Next Steps
1. Create basic type definitions
2. Set up debug infrastructure
3. Implement naive renderer
4. Build test patterns
