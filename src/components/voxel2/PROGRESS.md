# Voxel2 System Implementation Progress

## Overview

This is a clean reimplementation of the voxel system with a debug-first, incremental approach.

## Architecture Philosophy

- **Debug-first**: Build comprehensive debugging tools before implementing features
- **Incremental development**: Each phase builds on rock-solid previous phase
- **Clean separation**: Rendering, terrain, optimization as separate concerns
- **A/B testable**: Always compare new features against known-good baseline

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Debug Infrastructure âœ…

- [x] Basic type definitions (types.ts)
- [x] Debug system with pattern generators
- [x] Performance monitoring tools
- [x] Test pattern infrastructure

### Phase 2: Basic Rendering âœ…

- [x] Simple chunk data structure
- [x] Naive cube-per-voxel renderer

- [x] Fixed inverted normals in naive renderer

### Phase 3: Multi-Chunk System âœ…

- [x] Chunk loading/unloading
- [x] Cross-chunk face culling

- [x] Camera controls and tracking
- [x] Debug terrain generation with render distance

### Phase 4: Advanced Features ðŸ”„

- [ ] Binary greedy meshing optimization with reference repository: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TanTanDev/binary_greedy_mesher_demo/main/src
  - [ ] Implement bitwise operations for face culling
  - [ ] Create optimized data structures using BigInt
  - [ ] Build greedy quad generation algorithm
  - [ ] Add performance comparison tools
- [ ] A/B testing vs naive renderer
- [ ] LOD system
- [ ] Complex terrain generation

## Current Status: ðŸš€ Phase 4 - Binary Greedy Meshing Implementation

### Binary Greedy Meshing Plan (NEW)

Based on research of TanTanDev's Rust implementation and the "Greedy Meshing Voxels Fast" conference talk from Handmade Seattle 2022:

#### Core Algorithm Steps:

1. **Binary Occupancy Masks**: Create 64x64 BigInt arrays where each bit represents voxel solidity
2. **Bitwise Face Culling**: Use bit operations to cull 64 faces simultaneously
3. **Greedy Quad Expansion**: Merge adjacent faces using bitwise operations

#### Implementation Files:

- `meshing/BinaryGreedyMesher.ts` - Main algorithm implementation
- `meshing/BinaryChunkData.ts` - Optimized chunk data structures
- `meshing/BitMaskUtils.ts` - Bitwise operation utilities
- `meshing/GreedyQuadGenerator.ts` - Quad generation logic
- `rendering/GreedyMeshRenderer.tsx` - React component for rendering

#### Performance Targets:

- 100-500Î¼s per chunk (vs current naive approach)
- 60-80% triangle reduction through aggressive merging
- Support for 64x64x64 chunks with neighboring data

## Lessons Learned from Voxel1

1. **Start simple**: No LOD until basic system works perfectly
2. **Debug infrastructure first**: Pattern generators and comparison tools from day 1
3. **Clean interfaces**: Avoid mixing terrain generation with rendering concerns
4. **Systematic validation**: Test each feature in isolation before combining
5. **Coordinate system clarity**: Be very explicit about world vs local vs scaled coordinates

## Next Steps

1. Create basic type definitions
2. Set up debug infrastructure
3. Implement naive renderer
4. Build test patterns
